Pet Management System
This project is an IoT-based pet management system designed to enhance real-time health monitoring and safety for pets. The system integrates advanced machine learning algorithms, geofencing technology, and data visualization tools to provide comprehensive and actionable insights for pet owners.

Project Structure
data analysis: Contains scripts and tools used for analyzing collected data from pets, including health metrics and movement data.

data generate: Scripts to generate synthetic data for testing and validation purposes, including various health conditions and geographical scenarios.

data wrangling: Data preprocessing scripts for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

database: Database schema and scripts for storing and managing collected data, supporting both current and historical data analysis.

geofencing: Contains the implementation of geofencing technology used to establish virtual boundaries and monitor pet movement in real-time.

machine learning: Machine learning models and algorithms for detecting health anomalies in pets, including Isolation Forest, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

model evaluation: Scripts and tools for evaluating the performance of the machine learning models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score calculations.

models: Pre-trained models and configurations used in the anomaly detection and health monitoring of pets.
